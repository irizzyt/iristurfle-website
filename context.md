README

Project purpose
This project builds a stronger version of my current website. It keeps my content. It improves layout, structure, spacing, and presentation. It uses a reference website as the design model. The goal is a clean, modern, responsive site that feels polished and intentional.

Design goals
I want a site that feels organized. I want clear hierarchy. I want strong typography. I want consistent spacing. I want fast load times. I want a layout that feels similar to the reference site without copying code.

Core requirements
• Rewrite weak HTML and CSS.
• Improve structure in index.html.
• Use modern CSS features for layout and responsiveness.
• Rebuild the hero section with better spacing, typography, and alignment.
• Improve the navigation bar and header sizing.
• Redesign cards, buttons, and content blocks.
• Standardize fonts and sizing.
• Improve the mobile experience with predictable breakpoints.
• Remove clutter.
• Improve spacing across all sections.

Reference site instructions
Use the reference site that I provide in Cursor. Copy the layout logic, spacing patterns, flow, and visual hierarchy. Do not copy code. Use it only as a guide for structure and style.

Files to update
• index.html
• styles.css
• effects.js
• Assets folder when needed

How the AI should work
• Read my current files.
• Compare them to the reference site.
• Redesign the layout.
• Update code directly.
• Output full updated files.
• Tell me what changed and where.

Outcome
The final site should look like a cleaner, more professional version of my original work. It should follow the structure and style of the reference site while keeping my content and identity.

Here are features you can add to make your site feel sharp, ambitious, and unforgettable. These are practical components that fit a personal website but also give it a high-end, portfolio-level feel.

You can add this block to your README as an addendum. It explains what your AI should build, how it should think, and what the final product should look like.
